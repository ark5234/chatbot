The Truchard Vineyard is perfectly located in the hills above Highway 12 with the San Francisco Bay influences creating a cooler growing climate where the grapes ripen slowly and perfectly on the vine. The perfect weather combines with an ideal terroir to create the foundation for a well-balanced Chardonnay aged for 10 months in 40% new American Oak barrels. We also offer an annual harvest of Sauvignon Blanc which is sourced from North Coast vines outside of the Napa Valley. The tropical nature of our 2023 Sauvignon Blanc is decidedly different than the typical Sauvignon Blanc grown in the Valley and elsewhere in the World. Due to its limited supply, this wine sells out quickly each year so be sure to give us a call before visiting our tasting room to check availability."]

He became fascinated with wine and the science of winemaking and began to learn everything he could about the process.\n\nWhile interviewing for that 'real job', the interviewer asked him what he had been doing with his time since graduation. After speaking passionately and at length about wine, the interviewer said, 'You seem to love that so much. Why do you want this job?' Rob realized he didn't want it, actually. He thanked the man, and thus began a career in the wine industry.\n\nRob has since earned his MS in Viticulture & Enology from the University of California Davis and worked for many prestigious wineries including Cakebread, Stag's Leap Wine Cellars, and La Crema. Rob began crafting Jessup Cellars in the 2009 season and took the position of Director of Winemaking at Jessup Cellars in 2010. He now heads up our winemaking for the Good Life Wine Collective, which also includes Handwritten Wines.", "While interviewing for that 'real job', the interviewer asked him what he had been doing with his time since graduation.

While it is 96.7% Pinot Noir with fruit sourced from our favorite Los Carneros Truchard Vineyard, our master winemakers blend in a little (3.3%) of our own Petite Sirah from our estate vineyard in the Wooden Valley area of Southeastern Napa County and age it in 50% new French oak for 10 months. The alcohol content of this vintage is 14.8% with a PH of 3.45. This gives our 2021 Pinot Noir a much bolder color, very different from your typical light and bright Pinot you may be accustomed to. This also adds body to the wine which has become a member favorite at Jessup Cellars, priced at $70 for non-members."]

The terroir is ideally suited for a full bodied Merlot and like many of our wines, our Merlot is reflective of the 'Art of the Blend' by our winemakers. The 2019 Merlot is 80% Merlot, 16.5% Cabernet Sauvignon from the Chiles Valley AVA in Northeastern Napa County and a splash of our Petite Sirah (3.5%) from the same location finishes the wine perfectly. Our merlot is aged for 22 months in 40% new American/French oak with an alcohol content of 15.1% with a PH level of 3.55. This wine drinks well now, however, will continue to age gracefully for another 5-8 years.  We recommend trying this delicious Merlot with roasted chicken and vegetables or beef bourguignon.

As with most of our red wines, our winemakers exercise 'The Art of the Blend' by starting with 90% Napa Valley fruit from the Chiles Valley AVA in Northeastern Napa County, then blend in 5% Petite Sirah from the same AVA, 3% Merlot from our Truchard Vineyard in the Los Carneros region, then finish it with 2.1% Cabernet Franc, which is the parent grape of both Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, often used in blended wines. Cabernet Franc originated in the Bordeaux region of France and to honor that provenance, we age our 2019 Jessup Cellars Cabernet Sauvignon in 80% new French oak for 22 months. Alcohol content in this varietal is 14.9% with a PH of 3.65. You can purchase our 2019 Cab for $90.\n\nThe palate of the wine matches the aromatics providing juicy fruit flavors, rich tannins and a long finish. This wine drinks well now however will age gracefully for the next 5-8 years.\n\nEnjoy this Cabernet Sauvignon with a quality cut of beef or any dish that has a nice smoky/fatty/or charred quality."]
